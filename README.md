This code is used to analyze customer reviews, and there are more than 960,204 reviews in this dataset. By drawing the word cloud map, we can more quickly and intuitively understand the evaluation of most customers on the product. Moreover, kmeans algorithm is used to analyze the evaluation differences among different customer groups and find out the potential trends and commonalities. Before clustering, we first preprocessed the data, including removing stops, punctuation marks and other irrelevant information, to ensure the quality and accuracy of the data. Next, TF-IDF (word frequency-inverse document frequency) is used to vectorize the evaluation content, so that the text data can be recognized by KMeans algorithm.
KMeans clustering results can be used for market segmentation, product improvement, and customer service optimization. By analyzing the feature words of different clusters, we are able to identify the concerns of each group, such as price, quality, function, etc. Finally, the distribution of each cluster and its main characteristics can be clearly displayed to further facilitate data-driven business decisions.
